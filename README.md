# Library Management System

## Project Overview
The Library Management System is a web application built using Flask and SQLAlchemy, designed to streamline the management of books, users, and borrow records in a library setting. It features comprehensive CRUD operations allowing administrators to manage users and books, keeping track of borrowing and returning records efficiently.

## Installation

To set up this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/library-management-system.git
   cd library-management-system
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install required packages:**
   If you have a `requirements.txt` file, you can install the dependencies using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   If not, manually install Flask and Flask-SQLAlchemy:
